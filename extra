My brothers and brothers-in-law saw and said nothing, for times had changed and nobody was ashamed of relations who were Hassidim. For meanwhile rich sons-in-law from other towns had come who followed Hassidic practices and had even established a Hassidic prayer house and made the journey to their rabbis quite openly. My husband did not go to pray regularly at the Hassidic house, but he practiced Hassidism and brought up the boys to be Hassidim; and from time to time he made the journey to his rabbi.
A year before our oldest son became Bar Mitzvah the plague came and many fell sick with it, the Merciful One deliver us.
There was not a house without someone ill. The illness struck us and our oldest son became sick. At last the Blessed Name had mercy on him, but not for long. After he recovered from his illness he began to study the laws of phylacteries in the big edition of the Shulhan Arukh. And I saw this and was happy that his Hassidism had not impaired his scholarship.
One day our son got up early in the morning and went to the Study House. There he found a man dressed in shrouds
like a corpse. That corpse was not a corpse but, the Merciful One deliver us, a madman who used to do crazy things. The child was terrified and fainted. With difficulty they brought him back to life. To life, but not to long life. After that he went on flickering like a memorial candle during the closing prayer on Yom Kippur. And before he ever had a chance to put on his phylacteries he gave up his soul and died.
During the seven days of mourning I sat thinking to myself, My son died at the close of the Sabbath, after the Havdala ceremony, thirty days before his time for putting on phylac-teries, and it was at the close of the Sabbath after the Havdala ceremony thirty days before I was to go under the bridal canopy with Shraga that father tore up the betrothal agree-ment. I reckoned out the times, and was shaken that these two evil events had happened on the same day and at the same hour. And even if this were nothing but chance, it was something that had to be thought over.
Two years later his brother reached the time to become Bar Mitzvah. He reached it but never arrived. It happened that he went to the wood of our town with his friends, in order to bring back branches for the Shavuot Festival. While they were in the wood he left them and went to the scribe to see his phylacteries which were being prepared; and he never came back. We thought that gypsies must have kidnaped him, since a band of gypsies was seen passing through town. A few days later his body was found in the big swamp near the wood, and we knew that the child had lost his way and fallen into the swamp.
When we rose from our mourning I said to my husband What is left to us but a little girl? If we do not beg Shraga's forgiveness she will end like her brothers.
During all these years we had heard nothing about Shraga.
For once he and all his father's household had left our town they had been forgotten, and we did not know where they were. Shraga, said my husband, was a Hassid, a follower of
Rabbi So-and-so. I'll make the journey to him and find out where Shraga is.
My husband was not one of the Hassidim of that rabbi. On the contrary, he was opposed to him on account of a dispute between the Hassidic rabbis; all because of a slaughterer whom one of them had appointed while the other had had him dismissed. In the course of that dispute a Jew was killed and several families were uprooted and several householders lost their property and several of them lived out their days in prison.
So my husband made the journey to the rabbi. Before he reached his town the rabbi had died, and his sons shared out his following and authority among themselves and each one went to a different town. My husband went from one son to another to ask about Shraga, yet they did not know. At last they told him, If it's Shraga you're asking about, Shraga has been spoiled and become a Misnaged. But where he was they did not know.
When a man is a Hassid you can find him.. If he is not a follower of one rabbi, then he is a follower of another. But as for an ordinary Jew, if you don't know where he is, how are you going to find him? My husband, may he rest in peace, was used to traveling, and his business affairs took him to a large number of places. Now whenever he journeyed he asked about Shraga. What with all his journeys my husband grew weak and began to cough blood. Once, while on a trip somewhere, he became ill and died.
After I had put up a tombstone over his grave I returned to my town and went into business. While my husband lived I had already been helping him in his affairs, and now he was dead I threw myself entirely into business. The Blessed Name redoubled my strength, so that folks said, She has the energy of a man. It might have been better if I had been granted wisdom instead of strength and energy, but the Lord is a knowing God Who does not require the opinions of His creatures as to what
is good. I thought to myself, All my toil I am toiling for my daughter, so the more wealth I acquire the more I shall benefit her. The affairs increased so that I had no time for my home apart from Sabbaths and Festivals, and even then half the day was spent in synagogue and half in receiving guests. To all appearances my daughter did not need me, since I had taken teachers for her and she was busy with her studies and I received many praises about her. And even the Gentiles who mock at us for speaking an outlandish tongue used to praise my daughter, and said that she spoke their tongue with the best of them.
And above all, the Gentile teachers made much of her and invited her to their homes. I called the matchmakers and they found me a bridegroom renowned for his knowledge of Torah and an ordained rabbi.
But I never had the privilege of leading them to the canopy, for an evil spirit entered into my daughter and she became crazy.
And now this is what I ask of you, my son, Write to Shraga that I have forgiven him for all the troubles which have come upon me on his account; and write to him that he too has to forgive me, since I have already been stricken enough.
I sat silent, saying never a word. Then I put a finger to my eyes and wiped away my tears. Then I said to Tehilla, Please tell me, since the day when your father tore up the betrothal agreement more than ninety years have gone by. Do you suppose that Shraga is still alive? And if he is alive, has the place where he is been revealed to you?
Shraga is no longer alive, said Tehilla. Shraga is dead. He passed thirty years ago. And how do I know the year of his passing? Well, that year on the seventh day of Adar I went to say the Afternoon Prayers. After they had read the passage from the Prophets, during the memorial prayer for the dead, I heard Shraga's name. After the prayer I asked the sexton, Who is this Shraga whom you mention? He said, So-and-so son of so-and-so, his kinsman, instructed me to cause his name
to be remembered. I went to so-and-so and heard what I heard.
If Shraga is dead, said I to Tehilla, how do you wish to send him a letter? You must be thinking, she answered, that the old woman has turned senile, counting as she does on post offices to deliver the letter to a dead man.
Then what will you do? I asked.
She rose and took the jar on the table and raised it aloft and said in a kind of chant, I shall take the letter and place it in the jar, and take the sealing wax and seal the jar over, and take the jar and its letter together with me.
And if you do take the jar and the letter, I thought to myself, I still do not see how the letter is going to reach Shraga. I looked at her and asked, Where will you take it, where will you take the jar with the letter? Tehilla laughed sweetly and said in a sing-song. Where shall I take the jar? I shall take it to my grave, to my grave I shall take the jar with the letter. There in the World on High they know Shraga and they know where he is. And faithful are the messengers of the Blessed Holy One, who will deliver my letter into his hands.
Once again Tehilla laughed her sweet laugh, the triumphant laugh of a child who has outwitted her elders. Then she rested her head on her cane and seemed to be sleeping. After that she raised her head and looked right at me and said, Now that the whole matter is clear to you, you can write yourself. And as she spoke she rested her head once again on her cane.
I took the quill and wrote. After I had finished the letter Tehilla raised her head and asked, Have you ended already?
I stood up and read it to her, while she sat with closed eyes as though she had dismissed the matter from her mind and did not wish to hear it. After I finished reading she opened her eyes and said, Good, my son, good. You have expressed my thought. The matter might have been written in a different way, but even thus, as you have written it, the things are sufficiently clear. Now, my son, give me the quill and I shall
sign my name to the letter and put the letter in the jar. Afterward I go to confirm the contract.
I dipped the quill in ink and handed it over to her. She took it and signed her name. Then she ran the quill over several letters in order that they might be more clear. After that she folded the letter and placed it inside the jar and wrapped a piece of parchment round the mouth. Then she lit a candle and took the sealing wax and held it over the flame until it was soft, and after that she sealed the jar all round. Then she rose and went to her bed. There she raised the cover and placed the jar under the pillow. Then she looked at me with gentle eyes and said softly, I shall hurry over to confirm the contract.
Bless you, my son, for going to this trouble on my behalf.
From now on I shall not bother you any more.
As she spoke she straightened the bedcover, took her scarf, went to the door, straightened herself, set her lips to the mezuza on the doorpost and waited for me until I went out.
She followed, locked the door and walked off briskly. I went after her.
As she walked she looked with gentle eyes at every spot we passed, and at each person who passed us. Suddenly she stopped and said, Tell me, my son, how can one leave such holy places and such fit and worthy Jews as these? I did not yet know where all this was leading.
When we reached the parting of the ways she halted and bid me farewell. I shall go with you, said I. We took another few steps onward, and then she stopped again, saying, I have already reached my place. Farewell. But seeing that I was determined to go with her she said nothing more. She went up the broad steps leading to the courtyard of the Burial Society offices and entered. I followed.
We entered the Burial Society building. Two clerks sat there, their ledgers before them and their pens in their hands, sitting and writing while blowing at little cups of black coffee.
When they saw Tehilla they put down their pens and rose out
of respect saying, Blessed be she who comes; and they quickly placed a chair for her. What brings you here? asked the older one. To fulfill the contract, she answered. You have come to fulfill the contract, said he, and we think that the time has come to cancel it. What are you saying? exclaimed Tehilla startled.
Why, said he, surely you have already withdrawn from the Society of Diers. Smiling at his joke he turned to me and said, Tehilla, may her days and years be lengthened, has the practice of coming year by year to confirm the bill of sale for her place on the Mount of Olives. So it was last year and so two years ago and three years ago and ten and twenty and thirty years ago, and so will she keep on doing until the Redeemer comes.
The Redeemer will come, said Tehilla, he will come indeed, and may he come speedily. But I shall not bother you any more. Can you possibly be going to a kvutza, asked the clerk wonderingly, like those young girls whom they call halutzot.
I am not going to any kvutza, said Tehilla. I am going to my own place.
Are you going back abroad? asked the clerk. From this land I am not going back, said Tehilla, I am returning to the place from which I come; as it is written, "And unto the dust thou shalt return."
Na, na, said the clerk, whistling through his lips. Do you really suppose that the Holy Burial Society hasn't anything to do? Take my advice and wait another twenty or thirty years. What's all this hurry? She whispered, I have already ordered the purifiers and washers to come, and it would be unbecoming to play with those good women.
The clerk's face fell and sadness was written all over him.
Then he said, How good it is for us to see you with us here, for as long as we see you we have an example of long life; but now that you wish to leave us, God forbid, it is as though you deprive us of the example.
If I still have years to live, said Tehilla, I gladly give them to you and to all who wish for life. Here is the contract. Sign it.
After the clerk had signed the bill of sale, Tehilla took it and placed it in her dress and said, Henceforward I shall not trouble you any more. May the Name be with you, dear Jews. Now I go to my own place.
She rose, went to the door, raised her mouth to the mezuza on the doorpost, kissed it and went out.
Seeing that I was accompanying her she stood still and said, Go back to your affairs, my son.
When you told me, said I, that you were going to confirm your contract I thought that you were referring to the contract for your home.
And as it turns out--she interrupted me and said--and as it turns out I have gone to confirm the contract for my eternal home. May I not need to dwell there long before I rise with all the dead of Israel. Fare you well, my son. I must hurry to my home. The cleansers and purifiers are surely waiting for me already. I stood dumbfounded and silent and she went on and vanished among the houses and the alleys.
Next morning I went to the Old City to see how Tehilla was. I met the sage whose home Tehilla had pointed out to me. He stood and drew me into a long talk. When I parted from him he wished to accompany me. I am not going home, I told him, I am going to Tehilla. May you go after a hundred and twenty years time, said he. Seeing my astonishment he added, May you go on living, the saint has forsaken us.
I took my leave and went my way, thinking all the while, Tehilla has passed away and gone, passed and gone her way.
In due course I found myself at Tehilla's home. I opened the door of her room and entered.
The tranquil silence of her room was like that in a prayer room after prayer. On the floor gathered the last of the water with which they had purified Tchilla.
